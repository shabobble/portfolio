# Responsive Portfolio

Second week's homework for UNH Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a portfolio for our projects going forward that also functioned as a responsive web page. Our six main tasks were to ensure that:

* The portfolio included our name, a photo, and links to sections about us, our work, and how to contact us.

* All the links in the nav bar successfully scrolled down the page to the corresponding section.

* The works section of this page comprises links to our projects that appear as titled images.

* The image for the first project is larger than the others.

* Clicking on the titled image links takes you to the deployed web app.

* The page has a responsive layout that changes when viewed on different size screens.
